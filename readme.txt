Exercise 5

This program is similar to exercise 4 where we read data from a file and output it into another file through the means of communicating with two different threads. It is similar in that it requires mutexes but it adds an additional condition variable to allow the programs to be running in sync. The program runs the same just execute the file and it will write to the output file the correct output.
